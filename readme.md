## Project Vision



The vision of EasyChain is to make blockchain technology accessible and easy to use for everyone, by combining the power of decentralized finance (DeFi) with AI. Our platform aims to simplify complex blockchain functions such as token swaps, liquidity provision, and cross-chain operations by allowing users to interact through natural language prompts. This project is focused on providing user-friendly access to advanced decentralized services like token launching, decentralized exchanges, and token bridging across EVM and non-EVM chains.



## Features



### 1. **AI-Powered DEX**

Our DEX is built from scratch, enabling users to perform the following operations:



- **Create Pool**: Users can create liquidity pools with their selected tokens.

- **Provide Liquidity**: Supply liquidity into the pools and start earning rewards and fees.

- **Withdraw Liquidity**: Liquidity providers can withdraw their liquidity along with their earned rewards.

- **Swap and Multi-Swap**: Swap between tokens or perform multi-hop swaps using our DEX router contract.

- **Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools**: Liquidity pools are deployed across different chains, and users can manage liquidity while maintaining token ratios.

- **AI Integration**: Users can interact with the DEX using AI-powered natural language prompts, allowing them to call contract functions and manage their assets effortlessly.

- **Transaction Recording**: Every user transaction (liquidity added, withdrawn, or swapped) is recorded for future reference.



### 2. **Cross-Chain Token Launch**

Launch tokens across multiple chains in one click, including:



- **Supported Chains**: NEO X, Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum Sepolia, Base.

- **Easy Token Deployment**: Use AI prompts to select a chain and deploy tokens with initial liquidity across multiple chains simultaneously.

- **Cross-Chain Liquidity Maintenance**: The platform ensures that liquidity is managed effectively across chains.



### 3. **AI-Powered EVM to Non-EVM Bridge**

Bridge assets across EVM and non-EVM chains using AI:



- **Cross-Chain Token Swap**: Tokens can be swapped from one blockchain to another using the lock-and-release mechanism.

- **Lock Event Monitoring**: The backend monitors and records lock events triggered by users, while an executor releases tokens on the destination chain.

- **Bridge Status Tracking**: The backend tracks and provides the status of cross-chain bridge swaps, ensuring seamless token transfers between chains.

- **Supported Chains**: NEO X, Stellar, and all major EVM chains.

- **Rust Contracts on Stellar**: Securely bridge user tokens between EVM and non-EVM chains using smart contracts built on Stellar.

- **AI-Powered Execution**: Give a prompt to the AI bot, and it will perform the bridging operation in one click.



## How to Use



1. **AI Interaction**: Use the DAppâ€™s AI-powered interface to give commands for creating pools, providing liquidity, swapping tokens, launching tokens, or bridging between chains.

   

2. **Cross-Chain Token Launch**:

   - Select your chain (NEO X, Sepolia, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism).

   - Deploy your token and maintain liquidity using a single AI prompt.



3. **Token Bridging**:

   - Use the EVM to Non-EVM bridge to transfer assets from one chain to another.

   - The AI bot will automatically process the bridge request and complete the transfer securely.



## Future Scope



- **Upgradability**: Implement upgradable smart contracts to ensure long-term sustainability and feature enhancements.

- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the DApp for enhanced accessibility and user experience.

- **DEX Aggregator**: Build a DEX aggregator to provide the best rates for token swaps across different platforms.

- **Order Book DEX for NEO X Ecosystem**: Expand the platform to include an order book DEX specifically for the NEO X ecosystem.

- **Improved AI Prompts**: Continuously enhance the AI model to process more natural language commands, making blockchain interactions even simpler.

- **Bot Ecosystem for NEO X**: Create an AI-driven bot ecosystem for the NEO X chain, aiming for grants and further collaboration.



## Technologies Used



- **Blockchain**: NEO X, Stellar, Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum Sepolia, Base

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for EVM chains, Rust for non-EVM chains like Stellar

- **AI Integration**: AI-powered natural language processing to execute blockchain functions

- **Cross-Chain**: Bridges between EVM and non-EVM chains
