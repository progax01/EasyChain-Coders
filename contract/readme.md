# Cross-Chain AI-Powered DEX and Token Launch Platform

## Overview

This project is an advanced decentralized platform that integrates a **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**, a **Cross-Chain Token Launch** feature, and an **EVM to Non-EVM Token Bridge**, all powered by **AI** for seamless, user-friendly interaction. The platform is designed to provide users with the ease of interacting with smart contracts using simple AI prompts, enhancing accessibility while offering robust features like liquidity provision, multi-chain token launch, and cross-chain token bridging between EVM and non-EVM chains like Stellar.

## Features

### 1. **AI-Powered DEX**
- **Dynamic Pool Creation**: Users can create liquidity pools dynamically by selecting tokens of their choice.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity in the created pools to earn rewards and fees from transactions.
- **Earning Rewards**: Users earn rewards based on their pool shares, along with fees collected from each transaction.
- **Withdrawal of Pool Shares**: Withdraw your liquidity and accumulated rewards at any time.
- **Multi-Hop Swaps**: A swap router contract that supports complex swaps across multiple liquidity pools in a single transaction.
- **AI Interaction**: All DEX functionalities can be executed via AI prompts for ease of use.

### 2. **Cross-Chain Token Launch**
- **User-Friendly Token Launch**: Easily launch tokens on multiple chains with a single click.
- **Liquidity Maintenance**: Ensure proper liquidity distribution of the newly minted tokens across multiple chains.
- **Flexible Token Release**: Users can release their tokens at any time, with any amount.
- **AI-Powered Execution**: Token launch and management can be controlled via AI prompts.

### 3. **EVM to Non-EVM Token Bridge**
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Seamlessly bridge tokens from EVM chains to non-EVM chains like Stellar.
- **AI-Enhanced Interaction**: Utilize AI prompts to perform cross-chain bridging operations.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Ensure smooth and secure transfer of assets across different blockchain ecosystems.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required tools and libraries installed for EVM and non-EVM chain interaction.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Deploy Contracts**:
   - For EVM-based chains, deploy the DEX and token contracts using the appropriate deployment scripts.
   - For non-EVM chains like Stellar, follow the cross-chain deployment guide to connect the bridge.

3. **Interact via AI Prompts**:
   - Utilize the AI-powered interface to execute smart contract functions like creating pools, swapping tokens, providing liquidity, launching tokens, and bridging assets. The AI module will interpret and execute user commands directly on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Stellar, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and other EVM/non-EVM chains
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Rust (for non-EVM chains)
- **AI-Powered Interaction**: NLP models integrated for executing contract functions via user prompts
- **Cross-Chain**: Bridging solution enabling asset transfer between different blockchain ecosystems
