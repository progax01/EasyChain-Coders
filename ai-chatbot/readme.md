Chat Assistant for Blockchain Transactions
This repository contains code for integrating an LLM-based model that automates the process of calling contract functions on the blockchain. Instead of manually interacting with smart contracts, users can make queries in human language or NLP, and the assistant will automatically execute the respective blockchain transactions.

Features
Automate the process of calling blockchain contract functions
Private and secure, ensuring user data and transactions are protected
Scalable solution, designed for both developers and normal users
Natural language understanding using LLM (like GPT-4) for seamless interaction

Getting Started
This project allows users to interact with smart contracts through a chat-based assistant, which leverages natural language processing to understand the user's intent and automate transactions accordingly. This solution is designed to make blockchain more accessible to both developers and general users.

Prerequisites
Node.js (>=14.x)
MongoDB
An API key from OpenAI (for GPT-4)
Environment Variables
To run this project, you need to set up the following environment variables:

PORT=8001
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4
PORT: The port number on which the server will run.
DB_URL: The URL of your MongoDB instance.
OPENAI_API_KEY: Your API key for accessing OpenAI services.
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL: The specific OpenAI model to use, e.g., gpt-4.
Installation and Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-assistant-blockchain.git
cd chat-assistant-blockchain
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the environment variables:

PORT=8001
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4
Start the server:

Run the following command to start the server:

npm start

The server will start on the port specified in the .env file (default is 8001).

Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the assistant through the defined endpoints.

Send a natural language query to the assistant, and it will interpret your request and call the appropriate blockchain contract functions automatically.
The assistant is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making blockchain interactions accessible to everyone.
