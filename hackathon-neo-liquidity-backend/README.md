# Liquidity DEX Backend

## Project Vision and Features

The vision for this backend was to create a system that tracks and manages a **cross-chain liquidity decentralized exchange (DEX)**. The key features of this backend include:

- **Cross-Chain Liquidity Pools**: Users can create liquidity pools, add liquidity, and withdraw liquidity on different blockchain networks while maintaining the token ratio as set by the initial liquidity.
- **Token Swaps**: The backend ensures that users can swap tokens within these pools while maintaining the correct liquidity ratios.
- **Transaction Recording**: All user transactions (liquidity added, withdrawn, and swapped) are recorded for future reference.
- **Token Deployment**: The system supports deploying tokens across multiple chains simultaneously.
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Status**: It tracks and provides the status of cross-chain bridge swaps, ensuring seamless token transfers between chains.

### Liquidity DEX Features:
- Liquidity pools can be deployed across different chains and token pairs.
- Users can add and withdraw liquidity and also swap tokens using the liquidity pools.
- All transactions are recorded, making it easier to track user activity on the DEX.

### Token Launcher Features:
- Tokens can be deployed on multiple blockchain networks simultaneously using our platform.
